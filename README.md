# GravityNode
A small Swift demo of using radialGravityField in SceneKit

This demo show how to use a SCNPhysicsField.radialGravity() and add it to a node to simulate gravitational
attraction between nodes.  Also demonstrates how using a force vector to a node you can
simulate "capturing" a "planet" in the attractor node's gravity. This is a proof of concept for a game design.
